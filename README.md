# CornerstoneNeuralNetwork
Neural Network written in Scala for my GE 1502 end of year assignment at Northeastern University.

## Inspiration
For an end of year assignment, we were asked to study and tune a MATLAB neural network script written by my proffesor. I decided to write my own network instead to better learn through implementation.

## Note on Scala Convention
One might notice that my Scala code is not very "Scala like" at all, using mutation and unit methods to modify the network class as opposed to immutable classes with a more functional flavor. 

I did this for the marginal improvements in memory and speed. I will be writing a more Scala-like implementation of my classes in the near future to perform a comparison as to whether these decisions were actually justified.
