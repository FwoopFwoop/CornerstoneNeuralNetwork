# CornerstoneNeuralNetwork
Neural Network written in Scala for my GE 1502 end of year assignment at Northeastern University.

## Inspiration
For an end of year assignment, we were asked to study and tune a MATLAB neural network script written by my proffesor. I decided to write my own network instead to better learn through implementation.

## Genetic Algorithm
I implemented a genetic algorithm which finds an optimal amount of hidden layers, neurons per layer, epochs, learning rate, and adaptive constant. The algorithm isn't as complicated as it could be; I plan on improving the fitness function at some point.
